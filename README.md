# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification using CNN & Grad-CAM  
A Deep Learning-based Diagnostic Tool for MRI Scans


2. ðŸ“Œ Overview / Introduction

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with MobileNetV2 (transfer learning) to classify brain tumors from MRI scans into four categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

It also integrates Grad-CAM for visual interpretability â€” allowing users to see which areas of the scan influenced the model's predictions.

3. ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:

- âœ… Transfer learning with MobileNetV2
- âœ… Handles class imbalance using class weights & data augmentation
- âœ… EarlyStopping and fine-tuning for better training
- âœ… Grad-CAM visualizations for interpretability
- âœ… Outputs predictions and confidence scores to CSV
- âœ… Clean, modular codebase for easy extension


4. ðŸ§ª Model Architecture

**Base Model:** MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)

**Added Layers:**
- GlobalAveragePooling2D
- Dropout(0.3)
- Dense(4, activation='softmax')
